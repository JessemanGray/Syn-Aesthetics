An ongoing body of research and development has been invested into studying the effects of the 'uncanny valley' in film, animation, and visual media, but much less attention has been paid to how these reactions relate to other media that use AI algorithms to approximate human observation and interaction. Within these emerging technologies is the potential presence of an inherent stress-inducing quality in LLM-driven writing, speech, music, and chat models, possibly even extending to self-driving cars. Could regularly interacting with a generative pre-trained model instill a measurable sense of dysphoria?

This project seeks to explore that question through examining several datasets associated with the ChillsDB database, a collection of responses to chill inducing stimuli including film, speech, and music. By establishing a threshhold for the physical effects of chills, and qualifying them as a good or bad phenomenon, predictive models can be developed to prescreen other media for potential subliminal negative emotional response. 

While not perhaps the most dramatic or dangerous example of generalized artificial intelligence backfiring, the off-putting quality of the uncanny valley is a substantial obstacle in the adoption of these tools. If not analyzed more effectively and countered,  it could lead generative pretrained models to go the way of Zoltar. 

Description:

A comprehensive study of the 'uncanny valley' effect in AI-generated media, and its implications on AI adoption

Key Features:

Comprehensive analysis of various datasets from ChillsDB.
Detailed exploration of the 'uncanny valley' effect.
Insightful visualizations of the physical and emotional responses to AI-generated media.
Innovative approach to engineering more concordant AI models.

Installation
For this project I wanted to keep things lightweight and flexible to maximize accessibility and focus on EDA instead of trying to create a toolkit to address the question at hand. Google Colab Jupyter notebooks offer a user friendly framework for data science, and internally support some of the most effective packages and libraries for modeling and visualisation. The datasets we are working with are available in this repository, and also via Harvard dataverse here:

along with several other ChillsDb datasets that were not part of this project.

Usage
This project is a preliminary exploration of data that could be used to accurately gauge biometric responses to various media. Possible applications could include productizing to be included in fitbit and other wearable tchnologies, and research into quantifying the uncanny valleyt effect in different population groups.
