Overview:
A substantial body of research and development has been invested into studying the effects of the 'uncanny valley' in film, animation, and visual media, but much less attention has been paid to how these reactions relate to other media that use AI algorithms to approximate human observation and interaction. Within these emerging technologies is the potential presence of an inherent stress-inducing quality in LLM-driven writing, speech, music, and chat models, possibly even extending to self-driving cars. Could regularly interacting with a generative pre-trained model instill a measurable sense of dysphoria?

This project seeks to explore that question through examining several datasets associated with the ChillsDB database, a collection of responses to chill inducing stimuli including film, speech, and music. By establishing a threshhold for the physical effects of chills, and qualifying them as a good or bad phenomenon, predictive models can be developed to prescreen other media for potential subliminal negative emotional response. 

While not perhaps the most dramatic or dangerous example of generalized artificial intelligence backfiring, the off-putting quality of the uncanny valley is a substantial obstacle in the adoption of these tools. If not analyzed more effectively and countered,  it could lead generative pretrained models to go the way of Zoltar.

Installation:

I wanted to keep this project  lightweight and flexible to maximize access and focus on EDA instead of building a toolkit to address the question. Google Colaboratory is an open-source Jupyter notebook that offers user-friendly framework for data science, and internally support a diverse range of packages and libraries. It's especially good as as a scratchbook to test models and run multiple approaches to see which one works best for the datset at hand. Colab is kind of a sleeper hit, but it's been invaluable to me as a problem-solving tool. More info can be found here: 

https://colab.research.google.com/

and there is a link at the top of each notebook in the repository🙂

The datasets we are working with are available in this repository as well, or via Harvard dataverse here: 

https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/ADLSZE 

along with several other ChillsDb datasets that are not yet part of this project.

Usage:
This project is a preliminary exploration of data that could be used to accurately gauge biometric responses to various media. Possible applications could include productizing to be included in fitbit and other wearable tchnologies, and research into quantifying the uncanny valleyt effect in different population groups. 

Eventually I hope to expand current notebooks to include EDA of other datasets in ChillsDB, and continue sifting through to perform more fine-grained analysis. I also plan to include ongoing research into other examples of the uncanny valley effect in popular culture and historic context, such as reigious likenesses and artifacts, and the trope of the zombie apocalypse. By dissecting the concepts of 'good bad', and bad good', along with what I call the 'stained glass' effect, which is the ehereal quality of light that many GAN image generators seem to understand implicitly.
