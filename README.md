# Syn-Aesthetics
There has been research and development invested into studying the effects of the uncanny valley in film, animation, and visual media, but much less attention has been given  how these reactions relate to other media that uses AI algorithms to approximate human observation and interaction. There is the potential of an inherent stress-inducing quality present with LLM-driven writing, speech, music, and chat models, possibly even extending to self-driving cars. Could regularly interacting with a generative pre-trained model instill a measurable sense of disquietude?

This project seeks to explore that question through examining several datasets asspociated with the ChillsDB database, a collection of response to chill inducing stimuli including film, speech, and music. By establishing a threshhold for the physical effects of chills, and qualifying them as a good or bad phenomenon, a predictive model can be developed to prescreen other media for potential subliminal negative emotional response.
